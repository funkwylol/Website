            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>When I was in middle school I was obsessed with coding and math. I used to study these two subjects obsessively. At the beginning of my freshman in High School, I was so far ahead in math that I'd finish all my work before everyone else in my class, and my teacher started to notice this. She asked if I wanted to skip forward a class, and I took her advice and ended up taking precalculus as a freshman. While I was having my classes switched around, my high school counselor asked if I wanted to graduate high school early at all, since it was either that or during my junior and senior years taking math classes at the local community college instead.</p>
            <h2>Making the Decision</h2>
            <p>It took me a long time to fully decide to graduate high school early. It took a lot of grappling with parents and teachers who told me "not to sacrifice my youth" and to "appreciate the time I have there" and talking it over with my brother and with myself. But after talking with my brother, who at the time was finishing his Bachelors degree at UC Santa Cruz, when he told me that my nieces all suggested I just go all in and graduate early, I realized that my time and abilities would be better used in college than at any high school, online, prestigious or not. </p>
            <h2>The Experience</h2>
            <p>Graduating high school early has been a rollercoaster. My first reaction at the time of graduating early wasn't anything crazy, to me it didn't feel like anything changed, just that now I had a bunch of free time and didn't have to stress about all the classes I'd been taking in highschool anymore. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was free, like I had the ability to make whatever choices and decisions I wanted for myself. However there were also some problems having graduated early. For one, dealing with HiSET who proctored and administered my tests was a big pain. Their customer service was horrendous, as I tried navigating their website and emailing them so I could find out when I'd receive my Certificate of Proficiency or how I could send that Certificate to my college to enroll in classes, I received almost zero guidance or help, and while they did respond to my emails, they were often just restatements of what I'd said, and they offered almost zero help. I had enrolled in classes at SMC for the summer of 2025, but wasn't able to take any because I had a problem trying to get my certificate sent to the admissions office. It took 2 months for them to finally get my certificate, and it had taken me calling the customer service hotline and grappling talking to some man with a thick indian accent to finally direct to what obscure part of their website had the form to order a copy of my certificate to be sent to the admissions office. Overall, while it has given me an amazing opportunity, not many people go through this route, and so the people managing and administrating it are often just dormant workers.</p>
